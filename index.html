                <p>This responsive layout is based on an initial grid of four boxes. Once a box is clicked, it gets
                    resized
                    to fullscreen and the other boxes scale down and fade out. In the work section we experiment with
                    another transition which is to show a panel by making it appear from the bottom while scaling the
                    current one down. To see it in action, open the work section and click on one of the portfolio items
                    and
